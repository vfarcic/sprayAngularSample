                    Front-end development is decoupled from the server.
                    However, we still need to serve static files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images...) so it needs to be running as explained in the <a href="page/static/frontEndRunning">Development: running the application</a> section.
                    <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> will make sure that every time there is any change to the code, all tasks are executed and our change is visible in the browser.
                </p>
                <pre>
gulp watch
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Feel free to change any HTML or JavaScript code.
                    As soon as the change is saved, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> will re-run all tasks.
                    In case of an error, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> will worn us about them.
                    After <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> is run successfully, open the screen affected by the change to review them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following tasks are run as part of <code>gulp watch</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>jshint</li>
                        <li>concat</li>
                        <li>ngAnnotate</li>
                        <li>uglify</li>
                        <li>sourcemaps</li>
                        <li>jasmine</li>
                    </ul>
                    There is a brief description of each of those tasks.
                    Their execution is very fast and, since they are part of <code>gulp watch</code>, they will all run on every change to the code.

                        <a href="http://www.jshint.com/about/">JSHint</a> is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions.

    &lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;
        [Left-hand manu goes here]
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-9"&gt;
        [Screen body goes here]

                <h3>Concat</h3>
                <div>
                    Gulp will <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-concat">concatenate</a> all JavaScript files into app.js.
                    This way there is no need to include each new JavaScript file into the index.html file.
                    It is enough to keep the app.js file referenced.
                    Following is the snipped from the index.html file.
                </div>
                <pre>
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="/assets/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
                </pre>
                <h3>NG Annotate</h3>
                <div>
                    <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-ng-annotate">NG Annotate</a> adds angularjs dependency injection annotations.
                    Without it, our code would not work after it gets minified.
                </div>
                <h3>Uglify</h3>
                <div>
                    <a href="https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify">Uglify</a> minifies JavaScript files.
                    Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing its functionality.
                    Minified code is significantly smaller and results in reduced amount of data that needs to be transferred to the client ultimately making web pages load faster.
                </div>
                <h3>Source maps</h3>
                <div>
                    After the JavaScript code is concatenated and minified, it cannot be debugged without having a relation with original code.
                    <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sourcemaps">Source maps</a> fix that problem.
                </div>
                <h3>Jasmine</h3>
                <div>
                    <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
                    We're using it for all our front-end unit tests.
                    The test code resides in the test/html directory.
                    Structure of that directory mimics the assets/html so that the relation between the implementation code and tests is clearly established.
