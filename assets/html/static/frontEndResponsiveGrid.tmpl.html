                    Number of devices is increasing rapidly (laptops, mobiles, tablets, etc) and it is important that the application can be used across all of them.
                    Responsive design is one of the ways this can be accomplished.

                    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">Bootstrap grid</a> is a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.
                    It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.
