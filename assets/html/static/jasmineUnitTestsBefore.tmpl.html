<p>
    If you're using <code>gulp watch</code>, it should have displayed an warning saying that tests failed.
    If there are no failed tests, they we're probably written wrongly (test without the implementation must fail).
    For more information about tests please consult <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine (our testing framework)</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing">AngularJS: Unit Testing</a>.
