<p>
    After new tests are written, run them by executing <code>grunt jasmine</code> from the assets directory.
    Since implementation is not done, tests should fail.
    For more information about tests please consult <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine (our testing framework)</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing">AngularJS: Unit Testing</a>.
